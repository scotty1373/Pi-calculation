By using Machine Function to caculate the Pi.

The Machie Function is more efficiently than the Monte Carlo mathod.

This code can require the last Pi caculat result and compare with the last Pi caculate length, if the length not satisfied the require bit, recaculate the Pi data.

```
file exist pi length is: 1000000
Digit calculation:342423
data bit requeire: 3213
required bit is: 8
[3211 --> 3224]: 6587969981635
```
